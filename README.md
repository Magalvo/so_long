# So Long

Welcome to the `so_long` project! This repository contains a small, yet engaging 2D game developed as a part of learning and demonstrating proficiency in C programming and graphical library usage, such as miniLibX or SDL. The game is built with the aim of providing a simple, fun experience while showcasing the capabilities of low-level programming in creating interactive applications.

## Introduction

`so_long` is a project that challenges players with a simple objective: collect all collectibles in a level and reach the exit. It's designed to be lightweight, portable, and accessible, focusing on the fundamentals of game development, such as rendering, event handling, and basic game logic.

## Features

- **2D Rendering**: Utilizes miniLibX/SDL for drawing graphics and textures.

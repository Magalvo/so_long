# So Long 🎮

Welcome to the `so_long` project! This repository contains a small, yet engaging 2D game 🕹️ developed as a part of learning and demonstrating proficiency in C programming 💻 and graphical library usage, such as miniLibX or SDL. The game is built with the aim of providing a simple, fun experience while showcasing the capabilities of low-level programming in creating interactive applications.

## Introduction 🌟

`so_long` is a project that challenges players with a simple objective: collect all collectibles in a level and reach the exit 🚪. It's designed to be lightweight, portable, and accessible, focusing on the fundamentals of game development, such as rendering, event handling, and basic game logic.

## Features 🛠️

- **2D Rendering**: Utilizes miniLibX/SDL for drawing graphics and textures. 🎨
- **Simple Controls**: Move the player character using keyboard inputs. ⌨️
- **Level Design**: Includes multiple levels with increasing difficulty. 📈
- **Portable Code**: Written in C for easy compilation and execution on various platforms. 🔄

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- GCC or another C compiler installed on your system. 🧰
- miniLibX/SDL installed, if not included. 📚

### Installation
